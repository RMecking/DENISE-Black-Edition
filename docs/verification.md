# DENISE verification harness

## Purpose

The `tests/` harness exercises DENISE as an external MPI program. It generates
inputs, runs the unmodified executable, reads seismograms back into Python, and
checks numerical behaviour without depending on C solver internals. M0 provides
one homogeneous elastic SH case; it is a baseline for later refactoring, not a
complete physics validation suite. Python 3.9 or newer is required.

Install Python and build dependencies, then build DENISE:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libfftw3-dev python3-pytest
make -C libcseife
make -C src denise
```

Run all tests from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -v
```

For release verification and CI, make DENISE and MPI mandatory:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -v --require-denise
```

Run only the M0 physics checks or point at a non-default executable:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/physics/test_homogeneous_sh.py -vv -s
DENISE_BIN=/other/bin/denise python3 -m pytest tests/physics/test_homogeneous_sh.py -vv
```

`MPIEXEC` changes the launcher and `MPIEXEC_FLAGS` supplies extra launcher
arguments. In the default development mode, an absent `bin/denise` or launcher
skips integration tests with an explicit reason. With `--require-denise`, either
condition fails the run, and any skipped integration test is converted to a
failure. CI always uses this mandatory mode.

## Homogeneous SH case

`tests/cases/homogeneous_sh.py` generates every run in a fresh directory:

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Grid | 200 x 120 |
| Grid spacing | 10 m |
| Simulation time | 0.55 s |
| Time step | 0.0005 s |
| Vs | 2000 m/s |
| Density | 2000 kg/m3 |
| Source | (700 m, 600 m) |
| Ricker frequency | 10 Hz |
| Receivers | x=900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300 m; y=600 m |
| FD order / coefficients | 8 / Holberg 0.1% setting |
| CPML | 15 grid points, 2000 m/s damping velocity, 10 Hz |
| MPI decompositions | 1 x 1, 2 x 1, 1 x 2, and 2 x 2 |

The Courant number `Vs * dt / dh` is 0.1. Even using 2.5 times the nominal
Ricker frequency as a conservative bandwidth estimate, the shortest wavelength
has eight grid points. These choices are comfortably inside the stability and
dispersion checks printed by DENISE for the eighth-order Holberg operator.
Sources and receivers are outside the CPML, and the analysis window ends before
boundary returns can overtake the direct arrivals.

The model files are native single-precision floats in DENISE's x-major/y-inner
order. Geometry and the 115-record positional parameter file are generated as
text. Seismograms use `SEIS_FORMAT=2` so the reader has no dependency on
Seismic Unix or ObsPy.

## Checks and tolerances

Program-health checks require return code zero, a non-empty output file with
the expected number of samples, and finite values throughout.

For the travel-time check, each trace is converted to a moving mean of absolute
amplitude over one quarter of the nominal source period. The first sample at
5% of that trace's smoothed maximum is the observed first break. The same picker
is applied to the exact discretized DENISE Ricker wavelet; its causal source
delay is subtracted before comparison with `distance / Vs`.

The diagnostic absolute tolerance is:

```text
2 * dt + 0.25 / source_frequency = 0.026 s
```

Two samples cover time discretization and indexing. A quarter period covers
the finite-bandwidth resolution of an onset pick; the spatial discretization
is already constrained by the Holberg 0.1% setting and eight points per
conservative shortest wavelength. This tolerance was defined from sampling and
bandwidth, not from the measured result.

The propagation-velocity assertion is deliberately stronger. Raw first-break
picks at all receiver offsets are fit by ordinary least squares to
`t_pick(r) = t0 + r / Vs_fit`. The free intercept removes the constant source
wavelet and picker delay from the tested slope. The test requires the relative
error in `Vs_fit` to be at most 1%, and it also requires the maximum fit residual
to be no more than two timesteps (1 ms).

The 1% velocity tolerance follows from the numerical resolution. Picks are
quantized at 0.5 ms over a 0.2 s differential travel-time aperture; a one-sample
end-to-end perturbation is about 0.25% in slope. All source and receiver
coordinates lie exactly on the 10 m grid, so geometry introduces no rounding
error in this case. The eighth-order Holberg 0.1% setting and eight grid points
per conservative shortest wavelength keep expected FD dispersion well below
1%. The remaining margin covers picker quantization and small finite-bandwidth
or decomposition effects without inheriting the permissive 26 ms absolute
first-break tolerance.

MPI reproducibility compares complete 2 x 1, 1 x 2, and 2 x 2 seismogram arrays
against the 1 x 1 reference. Every variant requires relative L2 error at most
`1e-5` and normalized correlation at least `0.999999`. The four-rank 2 x 2 case
remains in the quick suite because the complete local suite takes only a few
seconds. Bitwise identity is neither tested nor required.

Each run writes `stdout.txt`, `stderr.txt`, and `run_metadata.json` into its
pytest temporary directory. Metadata includes the absolute executed binary
path and SHA-256, repository commit and dirty state, MPI ranks, command,
return code, runtime, and MPI version. Local Makefile variables and the current
compiler wrapper are recorded separately as local build context and are
explicitly not claimed as provenance for an externally supplied executable.
Travel-time and MPI tests additionally write
`travel_time_metrics.json` and `mpi_metrics.json`. Use pytest's
`--basetemp=/path/to/artifacts` option to retain them at a known location:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/physics/test_homogeneous_sh.py -vv --basetemp=/tmp/denise-m0
```

On failure, inspect the pytest assertion first, then the generated stdout,
stderr, metadata, parameter file, geometry, and seismogram in that run folder.

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/verification.yml` runs on pull requests targeting
`modernization` and by manual dispatch. It installs the Linux toolchain,
OpenMPI, FFTW, and pytest; builds both `libcseife` and `bin/denise`; runs the
pure-Python unit tests; then runs all physics tests with `--require-denise`.
The physics step sets `MPIEXEC_FLAGS=--oversubscribe` because the hosted runner
provides fewer CPU slots than the four MPI ranks used by the small 2 x 2 case;
this changes process placement only, not the DENISE model or decomposition.
Missing dependencies, build failures, skipped integration tests, and physics
assertion failures therefore fail the job.
