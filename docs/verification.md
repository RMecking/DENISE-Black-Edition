# DENISE verification harness

## Purpose

The `tests/` harness exercises DENISE as an external MPI program. It generates
inputs, runs the unmodified executable, reads seismograms back into Python, and
checks numerical behaviour without depending on C solver internals. M0 provides
one homogeneous elastic SH case; it is a baseline for later refactoring, not a
complete physics validation suite. Python 3.9 or newer is required.

Install Python and build dependencies, then build DENISE:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libfftw3-dev python3-pytest
make -C libcseife
make -C src denise
```

Run all tests from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -v
```

Run only the M0 physics checks or point at a non-default executable:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/physics/test_homogeneous_sh.py -vv -s
DENISE_BIN=/other/bin/denise python3 -m pytest tests/physics/test_homogeneous_sh.py -vv
```

`MPIEXEC` changes the launcher and `MPIEXEC_FLAGS` supplies extra launcher
arguments. If `bin/denise` or the launcher is absent, integration tests skip
with an explicit reason while the pure-Python harness tests still run.

## Homogeneous SH case

`tests/cases/homogeneous_sh.py` generates every run in a fresh directory:

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Grid | 200 x 120 |
| Grid spacing | 10 m |
| Simulation time | 0.55 s |
| Time step | 0.0005 s |
| Vs | 2000 m/s |
| Density | 2000 kg/m3 |
| Source | (700 m, 600 m) |
| Ricker frequency | 10 Hz |
| Receivers | x=900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300 m; y=600 m |
| FD order / coefficients | 8 / Holberg 0.1% setting |
| CPML | 15 grid points, 2000 m/s damping velocity, 10 Hz |
| MPI decompositions | 1 x 1 and 2 x 1 |

The Courant number `Vs * dt / dh` is 0.1. Even using 2.5 times the nominal
Ricker frequency as a conservative bandwidth estimate, the shortest wavelength
has eight grid points. These choices are comfortably inside the stability and
dispersion checks printed by DENISE for the eighth-order Holberg operator.
Sources and receivers are outside the CPML, and the analysis window ends before
boundary returns can overtake the direct arrivals.

The model files are native single-precision floats in DENISE's x-major/y-inner
order. Geometry and the 115-record positional parameter file are generated as
text. Seismograms use `SEIS_FORMAT=2` so the reader has no dependency on
Seismic Unix or ObsPy.

## Checks and tolerances

Program-health checks require return code zero, a non-empty output file with
the expected number of samples, and finite values throughout.

For the travel-time check, each trace is converted to a moving mean of absolute
amplitude over one quarter of the nominal source period. The first sample at
5% of that trace's smoothed maximum is the observed first break. The same picker
is applied to the exact discretized DENISE Ricker wavelet; its causal source
delay is subtracted before comparison with `distance / Vs`.

The tolerance is:

```text
2 * dt + 0.25 / source_frequency = 0.026 s
```

Two samples cover time discretization and indexing. A quarter period covers
the finite-bandwidth resolution of an onset pick; the spatial discretization
is already constrained by the Holberg 0.1% setting and eight points per
conservative shortest wavelength. This tolerance was defined from sampling and
bandwidth, not from the measured result.

MPI reproducibility compares the complete 1 x 1 and 2 x 1 seismogram arrays.
It requires relative L2 error at most `1e-5` and normalized correlation at least
`0.999999`. Bitwise identity is neither tested nor required.

Each run writes `stdout.txt`, `stderr.txt`, and `run_metadata.json` into its
pytest temporary directory. Metadata includes the commit, active Makefile
compiler settings, compiler and MPI versions, ranks, test configuration,
command, return code, and runtime. Travel-time and MPI tests additionally write
`travel_time_metrics.json` and `mpi_metrics.json`. Use pytest's
`--basetemp=/path/to/artifacts` option to retain them at a known location:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/physics/test_homogeneous_sh.py -vv --basetemp=/tmp/denise-m0
```

On failure, inspect the pytest assertion first, then the generated stdout,
stderr, metadata, parameter file, geometry, and seismogram in that run folder.
